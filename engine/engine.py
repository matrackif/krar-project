    1. Define initial models based on initial state (using satisfiable()), and add them to list of models
    2. Loop through the whole time of the scenario
        a. Find observations and the 1 action that occurs at time point t
        b. Loop though list of current models
            b2. Find the action that occurs at some time k such that k+d=t (The action that is affecting the model now)
                i. If action violates domain description ImpossibleAt or ImpossibleIf (at time k) statements:
                    *. Model won't be forked, go to step b
                ii. If action precondition at time k does not hold:
                    *. Model won't be forked, go to step b
                iv. If action CAN be executed at time k and it is a CAUSES statement:
                    *. Execute the CAUSES action, so make a deepcopy of the model for all solutions
                     to the boolean formula of the action effect
                     **. Remove the model that occurred at time k because it is no loner valid
                v. If action CAN be executed and it is a RELEASES statement:
                    *. Execute the RELEASES action, so make a deepcopy of the model for all solutions
                     to the boolean formula of the action effect while keeping the original model   
            b3. Loop through list of observations at time t 
            (Note that this occurs AFTER executing the action affecting the current model and modifying the fluents)
                i. If current state of fluents in this model at time t do not satisfy formula in observation
                    *. Remove this model from the list of models and go to step b (check next model)
